      "\n",
      "Entity resolution, also known as record deduplication, is the process of identifying rows in one or more data sets that refer to the same real world entity.\n",
      "Take an example.\n",
      "You're on ebay looking for a [hip data science accessory][sliderulewiki], but you're on a budget, so you decide to scrape the [ebay listings][ebay] for a few days to get a feel for the market.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the listings are confusing and you don't know how to aggregate them.\n",
      "Entity resolution to the rescue!\n",
      "You find an [authoritative database][sliderules] and map all the ebay listings to it.\n",
      "Now you can comparison shop, get that sweet Keuffel and Esser for way cheap, and impress all the data hipsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "But finding matching records is a hard problem in general.\n",
      "A major reason is that the criteria for identifying duplicates are often vague and impossible to encode in rules.\n",
      "In addition, from a purely computational perspective, the problem is quadratic in the size of its inputs: naively, all pairs of records need to be compared to find all the duplicates.\n",
      "In this assignment, we will begin to address both these challenges.\n",

      "For example, suppose we use simple counts as weights, and we want to interpret the string \"Hello, world!  Goodbye, world!\" as a vector.\n",
      "Then in the \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" dimensions the vector has value 1, in the \"world\" dimension it has value 2, and it is zero in all other dimensions.\n",
